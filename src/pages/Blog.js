      <h1>React Router Basics</h1>
      <h3>Navigating the Web Seamlessly</h3>
      <p>
        Building smooth, fast, and dynamic web apps is crucial in today's
        digital world, and React Router is a powerful tool that makes this
        possible. If you're creating a single-page application (SPA) with React,
        you will likely need React Router to handle the navigation between
        different pages or views without the hassle of reloading the entire
        page.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this beginner-friendly guide, we will walk through what React Router
        is, how it works, and some of its key features that make it essential
        for modern web development.
      </p>
      <h3>What is React Router?</h3>
      <p>
        React Router is a library designed to handle routing in React
        applications. In traditional web apps, when a user navigates to a URL,
        the server processes a GET request and returns a new page. However, with
        React Router, you can map specific URLs to React components, allowing
        navigation between different parts of your app without fully reloading
        the page. This approach creates a smooth user experience, making it feel
        like you're moving between different pages instantly.
      </p>
      <h3>How Does React Router Work?</h3>
      <p>
        React Router enables rapid, seamless navigation by providing key
        features such as:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Declarative Routing</li>
        <li>Nested Routing</li>
        <li>Dynamic Routing</li>
        <li>Navigation Components</li>
        <li>Programmatic Navigation</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Letâ€™s break down these features to understand them better. </p>
      <h3>Declarative Routing</h3>
      <p>
        Declarative routing is all about defining routes in a clear,
        straightforward way, using a simple syntax. Instead of using complex
        logic to determine which content to show, you declare which component
        should be displayed for each path.
      </p>
      <h3>Nested Routing</h3>
      <p>
        React Router also supports nested routes, which allow you to render
        different components within a parent route. This is particularly useful
        for creating pages with a shared layout or structure.
      </p>
      <h3>Dynamic Routing</h3>
      <p>
        Dynamic routing allows you to create routes that respond to variables or
        parameters in the URL. This is great for pages like user profiles, where
        the URL might change based on the user's ID.
